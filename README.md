# VoiceCommandsApp

This is a simple voice commands app for iOS implemented in SwiftUI.

## Instructions to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open it with Xcode 14. It's likely compatible with Xcode 13, though untested.

## Features

- Real-time voice commands (not tested due to hardware issues)
- Voice command extraction from audio files
- Clear button to remove all current commands
- Localization support (Setup is completed; translation and UI for changing the language are pending)
- Multi-language compatibility (mostly implemented in code, UI integration pending)

Note: The demo is using mock data for the real time voice commands. Could not test it because of hardware issues.
